          Umm Kulthum was born in the village of Tamay e-Zahayra, belonging to
          the city of Senbellawein, Dakahlia Governorate, in the Nile Delta to a
          family with a religious background as her father Ibrahim El-Sayyid
          El-Beltagi was an imam from the Egyptian countryside, her mother was
          Fatmah El-Maleegi, a housewife.She learned how to sing by listening to
          her father teach her older brother, Khalid. From a young age, she
          showed exceptional singing talent. Through her father, she learned to
          recite the Qur'an, and she reportedly memorized the entire book. Her
          grandfather was also a well known reader of the Quran and she
          remembered how the villagers used to listen to him when he recited the
          Qu'ran.When she was 12 years old, having noticed her strength in
          singing, her father asked her to join the family ensemble, upon which
          she joined as a supporting voice, at the beginning just repeating what
          the others sang.

        <p>
          Amin El Mahdi invited her into the cultural circles in Cairo. In 1924,
          she was introduced to the poet Ahmed Rami, who was to write 137
          songs for her and also introduced her to French literature eventually
          becoming her head mentor in Arabic literature and literary analysis.
          In 1926, she left Odeon records for Gramophone records who would pay
          her about double per record and even an additional $10,000 salary.
          She also maintained a tightly managed public image, which undoubtedly
          added to her allure. Furthermore, she was introduced to the renowned
          oud virtuoso and composer Mohamed El Qasabgi, who introduced her to
          the Arabic Theatre Palace, where she would experience her first real
          public success. Other musicians who influenced her musical
          performances at the time were Dawwod Hosni or Abu al-Ila Muhammad
          [fr].Al-Ila Muhammad instructed her in the control over her
          voice, and variants of the Arabic Muwashshah.By 1930, she was so
          well known to the public, that she was the example to follow for
          several young female singers. In 1932, she embarked upon a major
          tour of the Middle East and North Africa, performing in prominent Arab
          capital cities such as Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut, Rabat, Tunis, and
          finally Tripoli.
